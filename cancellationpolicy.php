For e.g., if the value of cancelled order was $500, then the customer is eligible to place an order of $500 for any medicine available on NewLandsPharmacy. 
If the customer chooses to reorder rather than refund, then he/she must reorder of equivalent amount, partial reorder is not accepted. For cancelled order of $200 a reorder must be of $200 only, if a customer’s order value exceeds $200, then they’ll have to pay the difference
